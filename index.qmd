## Before the course

You need to do the following before the course starts.

### Install software

We need you to install various pieces of software for the course. Please follow the instructions in the install page to do this. It is paramount you do this prior to the start of the course as it will allow you to focus entirely on the contents. Note that we assume a basic level of R, equivalent to our R for Beginners course.

### Recap

We will provide an optional recap of R basics that covers a lot of the R functions and concepts we will use in the course. We recommend spending some time refreshing your memory about R to allow you to focus learning about single cell sequencing.

### Check Hardware

Note that to fully access support we might need to engage in 1-1 calls & use the share screen functionality and as such you should have a microphone so we can hear you. Most laptops have in-built microphone/camera but if you work on a desktop PC you might need to plug in an external microphone or use an alternative device for communicating (e.g. tablet/phone).

## During the course

All the communications during the course will be done in our Microsoft Teams group. You will be provided with the link to access the group before the course starts.

As you join the Microsoft Teams group please say hello to all in channel `Welcome and Live sessions` and introduce yourself. Tell us where you are based and if possible, something you like doing in your free time too ðŸ˜Š.

The materials for the course will be accessed through a link that will be posted in the Microsoft Teams group together with some instructions on how to download them on the first day of the course.
