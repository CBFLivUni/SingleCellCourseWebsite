Please follow the instructions in the install page to do this. It is paramount you do this prior to the start of the course as it will allow you to focus entirely on the contents. Note that we assume a basic level of R, equivalent to our R for Beginners course.\n\n\nRecap\nWe will provide an optional recap of R basics that covers a lot of the R functions and concepts we will use in the course. We recommend spending some time refreshing your memory about R to allow you to focus learning about single cell sequencing.\n\n\nCheck Hardware\nNote that to fully access support we might need to engage in 1-1 calls & use the share screen functionality and as such you should have a microphone so we can hear you. Most laptops have in-built microphone/camera but if you work on a desktop PC you might need to plug in an external microphone or use an alternative device for communicating (e.g.¬†tablet/phone)."

You will need to have a microphone to communicate effectively. This group has a number of channels:\nGeneral: this channel will be used only by course leaders to provide any message relevant to the whole cohort. Please do check any notifications in this channel.\nInstallation and packages: This channel is available to ask support/questions with any problems regarding installations of software prior to the course.\nWelcome and Live sessions: you will use this channel to confirm you have joined the team. Live session meetings will be launched from this channel including the link for all to join the conversation\nChannels 2 to 6 are reserved to request help during specific sections of the course. Whenever you encounter a problem during a practical you should write ‚ÄúI need a chat‚Äù in the relevant channel. A member of our team will then reply to you and engage in a 1-1 conversation where would be able to assist you further.\nNetworking - new channel to let you interact with your peers - just fun stuff :)\n\nRequested support\n\nIdentify the channel that best comprises the work you are doing\nWrite ‚ÄúI need a chat‚Äù in the channel.\nA demonstrator will reply to you and will engage on a 1-1 video call.
